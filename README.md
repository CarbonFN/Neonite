*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

## FAQs

 * Will I get banned?
   * No, you won't get banned because Neonite V2 doesn't connect to any Epic Games related services.
 * How do I play with my friends?
   * Neonite V2 is a locally-hosted project, meaning it has no party or friends functionality.
 * Why don't I see any cosmetics in my locker?
   * We removed cosmetics because Epic Games made it clear it does not like services that offer cosmetics for free. If you wish for skins you're welcome to add them yourself.
